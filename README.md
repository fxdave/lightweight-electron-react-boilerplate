# Lightweight Electron React Boilerplate 
This branch is for those, who wants to compile their main thread too.

## Why?
I found it a bit complicated to setup, so this should be easy for everyone.

## Why not?
your code will not be there where you actually write. __dirname won't be the same.
Also it is tricky, but good luck for that!
